selector._domainkey.wabcomobility.com IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"

# DMARC Record
_dmarc.wabcomobility.com IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:admin@wabcomobility.com"
```

### 2. **Microsoft 365 Configuration**

1. **Enable DKIM signing:**
   - Go to Microsoft 365 admin center
   - Security & Compliance > Threat Management > DKIM
   - Enable DKIM for wabcomobility.com

2. **Configure SPF:**
   - Ensure SPF record includes Microsoft's servers
   - Add: `include:spf.protection.outlook.com`

3. **Set up DMARC:**

   - Gradually move to `p=quarantine` then `p=reject`
